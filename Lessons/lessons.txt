Optional:
---------
* A [Thingiverse](htpp://thingiverse.com) account for customizing models 


Lesson 1: Introduction to the Customizer
=========

### Objectives:
* Become familiar with the customizer on Thingiverse.
* Customize an object and download an STL.

The Thingiverse offers users the ability to display their models and designs through a sort of gallery.  The gallery can contain images, pdfs, zipped files STL models, OpenSCAD source files and many other file types. 

Most models on the Thingiverse are STL files. These are sort of like loaves of bread; they have been made to a recipe with a program like Rhino, Sketchup, Blender or OpenSCAD. They are more-or-less immutable and cannot be changed without a special STL editor.

OpenSCAD files are more of a recipe than a finished product. The recipe can be tweaked and modified to suit a particular need. When OpenSCAD is instructed to 'render' a design, it runs the recipe and bakes the finished product.  Some OpenSCAD designs are more tweakable than others depending on how they are created.

Explore this design and see what can be manipulated. Think about this might be useful.

1. Open [this thing at Thingiverse.com](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1201466/) and launch the customizer
  - Note: You will need a free Thingiverse account.  If you do not have/want a thingiverse account please skip to Lesson 2
2. Play around with the customizable elements.  Try to make a box that has the following dimensions:
  - X: 30, Y: 50, Z:25
  - Wall thickness: 2
  - xCompartments: 4
  - yCompartments: 1 

# ADD IMG 1.0

3. Create an STL and download it later by clicking on the "Create Thing" link.

### Questions:
* What could you customize on this box?
* Why is it useful to be able to customize objects?
* In what cases would a designer **not** want to provide a customizable object?
* What happened as you input different values?
* Which features did not seem to work properly?
* What features would you like to add to this object?

Lesson 2: Customizing in OpenSCAD 
=========

### Objectives:
* Become familiar with customizing parametrically designed objects in OpenSCAD.

Using OpenSCAD to edit an OpenSCAD file is very similar to the customizer at the Thingiverse. The biggest difference is you have access to all the lines and elements. You can change anything and everything.  If you are not careful in your edits, you may find that the code will no longer run properly. If you manage to completely break things, just delete the file and download a fresh copy.

1. Download [the OpenSCAD source](http://www.thingiverse.com/download:1878740) for this thing.

# ADD IMG 2.0

2. Open the file in OpenSCAD and find the [ Outside Dimensions ] section
  - Locate the line that looks like: boxX = 40;
  - Change the line to match this: boxX = 50; 
  - Press F5 to render a preview
  - try adjusting the X, Y and Z values; hit F5 to render the model again. Make sure each line ends with a `;`.
  - try entering a negative number
3. Try adjusting settings in the [ Compartments ] section
  - You may find that you can only adjust one of the settings; we will look more at this in a latter lesson

### Questions:
* What could you customize here?
* Which sections did not seem to work? 
* How is this different than using the customizer at Thingiverse?
* What advantages/disadvantages does this method have over working at Thingiverse?

Lesson 3: Variables
=========

### Objectives:
* Understand what a variable is in OpenSCAD.
* Explain how variables are useful in parametric designs.
* Be aware of 'scope'.


This section is a little dry and doesn't have a lot of practical things to do. It is pretty important though so this might be a good time to stretch your legs and get a cookie or an apple before you continue.

The changes you were making under the [ Outside Dimensions ] sections were to 'variables.'Variables in OpenSCAD are containers that can hold integers (1, 2, -99999990002), real numbers (-1.123, 6.022, 99.4), boolean (true, false), arrays ([0, 5, 100], [[3, 4 5], [55, 0, 2]]) and text ('Hello world!').

Variables are a convenient way to store values in an easily identifiable package. This method also makes OpenSCAD projects easier to edit and make adjustable.  Compare the examples below:

Example 1:

     union() {
          cube([5, 5, 30], center = true);
          cube([5, 30, 5], center = true);
          cube([30, 5, 5], center = true);
      }


#ADD IMAGE 3.0

Example 2:

    short = 5;
    long = 30;
    union() {
        cube([short, short, long], center = true);
        cube([short, long, short], center = true);
        cube([long, short, short], center = true);
    }


Both examples make exactly the same shape. Copy and paste example 1 into a new OpenSCAD file.  
1. Try and adjust Example 1 to match the image shown here. 
  -Hint the values are 2 and 40.
2. Now try with Example 2. 
  - If you're anything like me, you probably skipped the steps above and said, 'Yeah, yeah, I get it.' I encourage you to give step 2 a try just so you can actually try out using variables in a clean space where you can't break too much.

#ADD IMAGE 3.1

3. Try out example 3 below. This one is really surprising if you are new to OpenSCAD.

Example 3:

    short = 5;
    long = 30;
    union() {
        cube([short, short, long], center = true);
        cube([short, long, short], center = true);
        cube([long, short, short], center = true);
    }

    short = 2;
    long = 40;
    color("red")
    union() {
        cube([short, short, long], center = true);
        cube([short, long, short], center = true);
        cube([long, short, short], center = true);
    }


#ADD IMAGE 3.2

You probably expected to get this:

But you should have seen this:

#ADD IMG 3.3

This is because OpenSCAD does not handle variables in the same way as say Python or another programing language you may have used. It calculates all the variables first and uses the last state they are in when it begins drawing. This means you need to be aware of the 'scope' of your variables. More on this later. I'm just planting the seeds here.

Something to keep in mind when you create variables is that they are not just for your reference NOW, but also for you and others in the future. Just because 'foo' and 'dog' look like great variables for a one-off project now, they won't be at all helpful in six hours when you come bak to a section that started out as a test and turned into something useful. Try to use useful names. I like to be as descriptive as possible while keeping my variable names short. I also like to use cammelCappedNames or under_scored_names. 

In many programming languages variables that start with a Capital Letter are treated in a special way. It is good habit to start your variables with a lower case. Also, most languages will try to interpret dashes as a literal subtraction. A variable named-like-this in OpenSCAD literally means: 'named' minus 'like' minus 'this'.  Ugg. 

#### Questions:
* How can variables make your OpenSCAD designs better?
* What are some things to think about when naming a variable?  Explain to someone else how you will name your variables.
* What happened in example 3? Explain to someone else why you got that result.

#### Challenge:
* Make a shape like the one shown in Img 3.2

Lesson 4: Working with modules
========

### Objectives:
* Understand what a module is.
* Use a module to complete a task more than once. 

This lesson has lots of opportunities to make mistakes and break stuff.  It should be a bit more fun than the previous section. If you totally bork up the file, download another copy and start over.

Modules are sort of a special variable name that holds a recipe to do stuff. A module can do stuff and can also call to other modules and make them do stuff.

In this lesson you will work with the `dividedBox()` module that calls several other modules to draw the box, divide it up and add a lid.  You are about to add some extra lids to the model. Maybe you want to make sure you have a backup lid?

1. Locate the module `dividedBox()` and find the section that looks like this:

    translate([-boxX, 0, -boxZ/2+wallThick/2])
      rotate([0, 180, 0])
      lid();

  This section is actually all one line that does three things: 
  - moves the drawing 'pen' from 0, 0, 0 to the left side of the box
  - rotates the drawing surface
  - draws the lid()

2. Try to add a second lid to the right side of the box.  
  - Hint 1: everything should be exactly the same except for one character.
  - Hint 2: you need to move the second lid in the positive direction

# ADD IMG 4.0

#### Questions:
* Why is it useful to use modules? Think of a project where it would be useful to be able to make multiple copies the same object quickly.
* What would be a painful and boring alternative to using modules? 

#### Challenge
* Add a third and fourth lid in front and behind the box.
  - Hint: most of the code is the same once again, but you will need to move in the Y axis. 

Lesson 5: Writing your own module
========

### Objective:
* Write a module from an example.

Remember way back to the customizer lessons? Probably not. I'll wait here while you go back and look at the part where I told you to play with the compartments. You'll probably notice something strange about the yCompartment variable. 

Don't worry, I've got a cup of coffee. I can wait.

You probably noticed that you can adjust the xCompartment values, but that the yCompartment variable doesn't do antyhing at all.  This is because the yCompartment module isn't finished. I left it for you to try writing!

A few notes about modules before you jump in:
* Modules can receive variables by putting variables into the parenthesies. When the module is called it will expect a value to be 'passed' to it. In this case the (mostly useless) module 'sphereOmatic' expects to get the variable diameter. It will draw a colored sphere when called. 

Example 1:

    module sphereOmatic(diameter, myColor) { 
      $fn = 36; // set the number of segments a curve should have
      color(myColor) sphere(r=diameter/2);} // set the color and draw a sphere

    sphereOmatic(5, "silver");

# ADD IMG 5.0

Every time sphereOmatic is called, a new value for diameter and color can be sent.  Try out the example below.

Example 2:

    module SphereOmatic(diameter, myColor) { 
      $fn = 36; color(myColor) sphere(r=diameter/2);
    }

    sphereOmatic(5, "yellow");
    translate([0, 0, 20]) sphereOmatic(10, "blue");
    translate([0, 0, -20]) sphereOmatic(4, "green");

# ADD IMAGE 5.1

1. Try the code out above. Change the sphere sizes and colors.
2. Add a sphere to the left and right of the yellow sphere with the diameter 5 and the color silver and black.

Each time you call out the name of the module you send along with it a new diameter and a new color. These values are stuck inside the module. They are stored inside variables that are only available to sphereOmatic.  No other part of the script is aware of the variable called 'color'.  We say that the 'scope' of myColor is local to sphereOmatic. Variables like boxX and boxY are called 'global variables.' Any part of the OpenSCAD script can see them. They don't need to be passed around. We say the scope of these variables is global. This is a big topic that can take up an entire month in a Computer Science course. Don't panic if you don't get it yet. I just wanted to introduce you to the concept.  

What you need to know is this: If you run a module from within another module you need to send any information along that it needs to know. In this case the yDividers module needs to know how big the innner box is so it can make the divders the right size.  

The next section is really challenging and will probably take some trial-and-error to figure out exactly what you need to do. This would be a good opportunity to get some fresh air and a drink of water before continuing.  

If you cannot solve this problem, don't worry, you can continue on with the rest of the lessons and come back to this later.

3. Start out with a fresh version of the code and find the module `dividedBox()`
4. Find where `yDivider()` is called; make sure you pass the size of the innerBox to it.
  - Hint: look at how `xDividers()` is called just above  
5. Find the module `xDividers()` and take a look at what it does.  
6. Copy and paste the contents of the xDividers module into the yDividers module.  **DOUBLE CHECK** the opening and closing curly brackets. If you end up with too many your script will not run.
7. You will need to change a few things to make the code work properly.
  - Hint 1: you are working with the **y**Dividers now. Make sure you are working with the y dimensions everywhere inside this module.
  - Hint 2: you will need to adjust the `cube()` statement so the divider is drawn correctly  - Hint 3: The red highlighted pars of your drawing are the part you are working on 

# ADD IMG

#### Questions: 
* Why could you adjust the columns, but not adjust the number of rows at first?
* Why did you need to include the variable innerBox when you called `yDividers()`?
* Why do you think there is an `if` statement inside the module?
* What do you think the `for` statement does? Try to explain this to someone else.
* Try to explain what scope means to someone.

#### Note:
* A solution for the problem is given in the apendix at the end.

Lesson 6: Begin your own customizable project
========

### Objective:
* Define variables for a project.
* Create comment blocks for use with the Thingiverse Customizer.

You have enough experience now to begin creating your own customizable project. Along the way we will learn about the Thingiverse customizer and adding your own customized projects. Part of each section will include some sample code and a problem to solve.

You will be creating a customizable name plate like the one shown here.

# ADD IMAGE 6.0

Comment Blocks:
When OpenSCAD sees this `//` it ignores everything from the last slash to the end of the line. This is handy for leaving notes to yourself or others. Sometimes comments need to extend over multiple lines. When OpenSCAD sees `/* */` everything between the stars is ignored. This is called a 'comment block.' 

[Thingiverse Customizer:](http://customizer.makerbot.com/docs)
The customizer uses special comment blocks to help the customizer do its magic.

1. Open a new OpenSCAD project and create header like the one below. This is a Tab header for the customizer. 

    /* [Base] */

2. Look at the example image and think about the variables and values you will need to create the base. What variables should your users be able to adjust? Add some well named variables below that will set the X, Y and Z size of the base.
3. Create a module for drawing a base and call the module. Make sure this compiles.

    module base() {
    }

    base();


4. Add instructions to the base module to draw a rectangular base using the variables you created earlier. If you used different variables, feel free to use them. 
  
    module base() {
      cube([xSize, ySize, zSize], center = true)
    }

    base();

5. Challenge: Use a `roundedBox()` instead of a `cube()` for the base. You will need to import `MCAD/boxes.scad`.  Learn more at the [OpenSCAD wiki](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries).

#### Questions:
* What other variables do you think you will need in creating this project?
* Make a list of the variables you think you will need.
* Make a list of the modules you think you will need as you complete this project.

Lesson 7: Add customizable mounting holes
=======

### Objective:
* Write a module 
* Add appropriate variables 

In this section you will be positioning the mounting holes in the name tag.

You should have code that looks something like this now:

    /* [Base] */
    xSize = 45; // lenght of name tag
    ySize = 15; // height of name tag
    zSize = 3;  // thickness of name tag

    module base() {
      cube([xSize, ySize, zSize], center = true)
    }

    module base()

# ADD IMG 7.0

The name plate should have two mounting holes in either corner. The hole diameter should be customizable. The holes should move with the size of the name plate so they are located near the top right and top left corners. The position will need to be calculated based on the x, y and z size of the base.

# ADD IMG 7.1

1. Add a variable under the [Base] configuration for the hole diameter.
2. Create a new module that makes two holes in the corners of the base. Start with the code provide below and try to move the holes so they are both 1/2 of the diameter from the edge. Copy and paste this just above the `base()` module.

    module holes() {
      translate([-xSize/2, ysize/2, 0])
        // create a cylinder with 36 segments that is 2 times the thicknes of the base
        translate([-xSize/2+holeDia, ySize/2, 0])
          #cylinder(r = holeRad, h = 2*zSize, $fn = 36, center = true);
        translate([xSize/2-holeDia, ySize/2, 0])
          #cylinder(r = holeRad, h = 2*zSize, $fn = 36, center = true);
        
    }

3. Add a call just below the `base()` call to make the holes appear. Your code should look like this:

    module base() {
      cube(baseSize, center = true);
    }

    module holes() {
    translate([-xSize/2+holeDia, ySize/2, 0])
      #cylinder(r = holeRad, h = 2*zSize, $fn = 36, center = true);
    translate([xSize/2-holeDia, ySize/2, 0])
      #cylinder(r = holeRad, h = 2*zSize, $fn = 36, center = true);
    }

    base();
    holes();

4. When you are satisfied with the location of the holes make sure you remove the `#` debugging marks. The `#` mark highlights the element in transparent red.

#### Questions:
* What did you do to make sure the holes were 1/2 of the diameter from the edge?
* Why is this method better than hard-coding in a number for the placement of the holes?
* How does using a formula or equation help make this thing more customizable?

Lesson 8: Adding extruded text
========

### Objctives:
* Become familiar with the text and extrude functions
* Add appropriate variables 
* Create a new module

In openscad 2015.03 text support was added officially. Using the `linear_extrude()` built-in raised and embossed text can be easily added to projects. 

The [linear_extrude()](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Linear_Extrude) module has many features. We will only be using it in the most simple form here. See the OpenSCAD wiki for more information on other features.

Your next task is to add a module that will provide extruded text. Sometimes it is helpful to turn everything else off while you are working on a new feature. This can be done by simply adding a // in front of any line that you do not wish to execute.

Think back to the list of variables you made in the previous lessons. What variables do you think will be needed for the text?

# ADD IMG 8.0

1. Comment out the `base()` and `holes()` modules:

    //base();
    //holes();

2\. Create a variable block for customizing text under the [Base] block:

    */ [Text] */
    textHeight = 2; // height over base
    textSize = 7.5; // text size
    myColor = "yellow" // color in rendering 
    myFont = "Liberation Sans" // more on this later!

3\. Create a module for creating extruded text:

    module textExtrude() {
      // the following four lines are all actually one command that ends with the ';'
      color(myColor)
        linear_extrude(height = textHeight)
        text("My Name", halign = "center", valign = "center", size = textSize, 
          font = myFont);
    }

4\. Test out your code; make sure everything else is commented out

    //base();
    //holes();  
    textExtrude();

5\. This project is super boring with "My Name" on the plaque. Let's make that customizable. Add another variable under the [Text] block for customizing the text. Make sure you use that variable appropriately in the extrude module.

Questions:
---------
* What did you need to do to make the text more customizable?
* What do you think we need to do to join all these pieces together?

Lesson 9: Joining it all together
========
### Objectives: 
* Practice calling one module from another
* Practice using `union()`

Right now we have three separate parts that look like they are joined together. In some cases, this can be exported as an STL and it will indeed print properly on a 3d Printer. The text is not correctly placed however. Also, if we've made any errors in our placement of objects we may end up with something that *looks* printable, but that is actually impossible to print.  

We can solve this by joining everything together using OpenSCAD's `union()` and `difference()` modules. These are in the class of [boolean](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Chapter_5_--_Boolean_combination) opperations and could be a whole set of lessons in themselves.  

1. Create a module that contains all the separate modules we need to make the name plate. Call the module `makeTag()`
2. Check that everything looks like the sample image. Notice that the holes are filled in and that the text is too low on the name plate. We will fix that now!

# ADD IMG 9.0

3. In the module we need to `union()` the text and the base. The text needs to be raised up so it appears the proper height over the base. Start with the code below and try to figure out how to raise the text so it is EXACTLY the height of base from the origin. Also try to move the text so it doesn't run into the holes.

      module makeTag() {
        union() {
          base();
          translate([0, 0, 0]) textExtrude();
        }
        #holes() // turn on debug highlighthing to make this easier to see
      }

Lesson 10: Removing the unwanted bits
=========

### Objectives:
* Practice using `difference()`
* Practice thinking parameterically

You were probably tempted to move the text using hard-coded values like this:

    module makeTag() {
      union() {
        base();
        translate([0, -3, 1.5]) textExtrude();
      }
    }

# ADD IMG 10.0

That should put the text just about out of the way of the holes, but the text size is adjusted or the base size is changed, the text will look a bit odd. 

# ADD IMG 10.1

Instead consider moving the text so that it moves relative to the size of the base. Just like the holes, the text will move with the size of the base rather than being static. In this example the text moves down by 1/5 of the ySize and the text floats exactly at the surface of the base.

    module makeTag() {
      union() {
        base();
        translate([0, -ySize/5 , zSize/2]) textExtrude();
      }
    }

Finally you need to add the mounting holes using `difference()`. Difference starts with the top level object (first listed) and then begins removing each subsiquent object from the first any where the objects intersect. In this case the `union()` of base and text makes an new single object.

1. Add a `difference()` statement to module `makeTag()`

    module makeTag() {
      difference() {
        union() {
          base();
          translate([0, -3, 1.5]) textExtrude();
        } //end union
      } // end difference
    } // end makeTag()

2. Check that the result looks like the image above. Nothing should have been subtracted yet.
3. Add a call to the `holes()` module below the `union()`statement to make the mounting holes

    module makeTag() {
      difference() {
        union() {
          base();
          translate([0, -3, 1.5]) textExtrude();
        } //end union
      } // end difference
        #holes(); // turn on debuging to check the location, remove the '#' once done
    }  // end makeTag()

4. The final model should look like this:

# ADD IMG 10.2

Challenge:
---------
* Make the base a different color
* Use multiple fonts
* Use multiple shapes for the base
* Make a hexagonal base or a star shaped base

Questions:
---------
* What are some of the benefits for making models parametric?
* What are some of the disadvantages of hard-coding values?
* Explain how you think the difference and union commands work to someone else.

Lesson 11: Preparing to publishing to Thingiverse
=========

### Objectives:
* Setup variables for Customizer

The last step is to publish this thing onto the Thingiverse. Once you have published it anyone with an account can use the Customizer to make derivative things. This is great! You can share you ideas with other people and they can run with your ideas and make them bigger, more atristic, more rediculous and generally more awesome. 

The first step is making sure your thing is easy to customize. We've started out on the right foot by creating logical variable tabs and giving the variables sensible names:

    /* [Base] */
    xSize = 45; // length
    ySize = 15; // height
    zSize = 3; //thickness
    holeDia = 3.5; // hole diameter

    /* [Text] */
    textHeight = 2;
    textSize = 7.5;
    myFont = "Liberation Sans"; 
    myColor = "yellow";

The next step is to take advantage of some of the [Customizer Markup](http://customizer.makerbot.com/docs). Any variable without specific markup will simply be a user-input field.

# ADD IMG 11.0

Sometimes we want to limit the range of valid inputs. This can be done by using a range.

1. Add a range using the following format: // [minimu:maximum] description
    /* [Text] */
    textHeight = 2; // [1:10] height of text over base
    textSize = 7.5; // [1:50]


It is also possible to add a drop down menu of pre-populated options using list. Here's an opportunity to return to the font face choice. In version 2015.03-2 it is possible to use all of the system-installed fonts, but those fonts are not available on Thingiverse. Check the documenation wiki for more information on [fonts](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Text] and [colors](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#color).

2. Add a list of options using the following format: // [option1, option2, option3]

    myFont = "Liberation Sans"; // [Liberation Mono, Liberation Sans, Liberation Sans Narrow and Liberation Serif]
    myColor = "yellow"; // [green, yellow, blue, red, silver, black] Text color

One other useful customizer section is the /*[Hiden]*/ section. This section, as the name implies is hidden from view. This is a great spot to do calculations or set up variables for use elsewhere. If you know that you will be dividing a variable by 2 every time you use it Such as the holeDiameter, set this value in the Hidden section. 

When writing a program, if you do something more than twice by hand, you should consider finding another way of doing it.  Every time you divide by 2, or add two variables together manually you risk a typo that you will need to find and correct later. By limiting the number of times you make a particular calculation debugging and changes become much, much easier.

3. Add a `/* [Hidden] */` section and add a variable for `holeRad = holeDia/2;` 
4. Update your code to use `holeRad` in the `holes()` module.

### Questions:
* What types of variables in this project should be set as a range?
* What things should be set as a drop down list? Why?
* Can you think of a specific instance where you would want to prevent a user from inputting a specfic value? What about when division is involved?
* How can the [Hidden] section be useful to you as a desingner? How is it useful to other people that review your designs?
* How can setting variables under the Hidden section save you from errors later?

Lesson 12: Getting Ready to Publish
=========

### Objectives:
* Create an account on thingiverse
* Become familiar with Copyright licenses
* Choose an appropriate copyright license for this project

The final step in this is to upload your project to Thingiverse so other people can play with it, improve on it and share their work. There are a few things you will need to do before you can share this project.  
* [Create an account](https://accounts.thingiverse.com/register?)
* Choose a License 

Creating an account should be pretty self-explanitory. If you want to skip this step, continue on for some last little tid-bits. 

Here's a really interesting fact about Copy Right. You already have it. Once you hit the save key, you created a piece of work that can be copyrighted. The act of creation is all it takes. You have the sole right to decide who will use your work and how it will be used. Most of the stuff you see on the Thingiverse is copyrighted, but copyrighted in such a way that preserves the creators reputation, but allows anybody to make stuff and have fun with it. This is done through chosing a license that matches how you feel about your work.

Is your work super secret and the basis of your billion dollar business plan? Don't share it! Keep that to your self! Or is your work a good idea based on the good ideas of all those that have come before you? Or something in between? How would you feel about someone using your idea to make something new? How would you feel about someone profiting from your work? Once you've answered those questions the next steps should be easy.

Take a look at the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license page and see which license works best for you. There's a nice little 3 minute video that explains the basics of the licenses. 

Choosing a license is not complex, but does require a bit of thought. This set of lessons that you have been reading is released under the Creative Commons Attribute-Share-Alike License. This means that if you want to publish your own version of the sliding top box or the name tag you should give me credit and you need to share your designs under the same terms, allowing others to modify and share the work as well. It also means that you can't sell the design. You are welcome to make real objects based on the design and sell them, but you can not take credit for the designs and sell those as your own.

Giving credit is as simple as providing a user name, or an email address somewhere in your project. When you share your project on Thingiverse, or any other web site, you should also mention that your project is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribute-Share-Alike license so other people know where it came from.  

Thingiverse also provides GPL licenses and BSD license. These are more specific and apply more to software than creative works, but can be applied to almost anything. 

Because this project was originally released under the CC Share-Alike license, you really should choose the same license. I won't hunt you down and point a loaded lawyer at you, but I might give you a hard time if I come across one of your designs that is licensed in a more restrictive way.

### Questions:
* Why would you bother to copyright your work at all?
* Why should you respect the copyright of other's work?
* Which license did you choose for this project? Why? Hint: there are only a few right answers to this questions.
* Which license is best for work that you intend to share with the community?

Lesson 13: Uploading your project for Customization
=========

### Objectives:
* Publish a customizable project to Thingiverse

The final step is to get your project up on the Thingiverse and get the customizer running. You will probably need to do some debugging and upload the files a few times; that's pretty normal.

1. Create an STL and a PNG of your design in OpenSCAD; this will give you a nice image to share
  - F6 to Render
  - File > Export > Export as STL
  - File > Export > Export as Image
2. Sign in to your Thingiverse account and choose 'Create > Upload a Thing'
3. Drag or Browse to upload your STL, PNG and SCAD file for your project
  - Drag the thumbnails to organize the images in the order that suits you
4. Give your project a catchy name that is descriptive but short
5. Select a category. This fits well under Art > Signs and Logos
6. Choose a license. This project was originally distributed under the CC Atrrib-Share-Alike license. It would be best to share this project under the same license as that is keeping in the spirit of the Creative Commons and the original author's (my) wishes.
7. Tick the 'This is a Remix' box because you derived this from someone else's project
  - In the box below you can specify the project this was derived from (1201466)
  - This helps others see the lineage of the project and locate other users that are working on similar projects.
  - This is also nice for me because I get a little notice every time someone uses my work. It's like a little tip in my jar, but I can't spend it.  It just makes me feel good.
8. **Tick 'This is a Customizer'** to make sure this project is customizable.
9. Add one or two sentences summary that explains what this project is all about
10. If you would like to add any other instructions or notes you can use the Design section and the custom sections.  This is not necessary, but can be nice.
11. Save and view your project.
  -Now's the time to test the customizer. 
  -Make sure the customizer options appear as you expect. Make sure that things work like you hope. 
  -If you need to make changes, edit the project and remove the SCAD file. Replace it with a revised version and then repeat step 11 as needed.
12. Publish your thing using the link at the top of the page and share it with all your friends.

Congratulations! You've just created your first customizable, parametic project and shared it on Teh Intertubes!

Closing:
========
Thanks for making it this far. I hope you found this text useful and feel more confident using OpenSCAD and making parametric designs.

The next step is to download other people's libraries and SCAD projects and play with them. You can learn more from experimenting with other projects than I can teach you here. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to contact the person who created a project. Most authors will be thrilled to hear from someone who found their project useful. The urge to share ideas and learn from others is why most authors publish their works in places like the Thingiverse.

If you have any questions or comments for me please don't hesitate to contact me either through the Thingiverse or via email. I am happy to answer questions and would love to fix any mistakes you find.

Solution for sliding top box `yDividers`:

    module yDividers(innerBoxDim) {
    // paste below this point.  Be careful that you pay attention to the curly brackets

      echo ("This is the xDividers module");
      echo ("innerBoxDim=", innerBoxDim);
      // the number of dividers is always one less than the number of compartments
      cols = yCompartments - 1;

      // calculate the spacing of the dividers based on the dimensions of the inner box
      // element 0 of the innerBoxDim variable contains the X dimension
      // element 1 of the innerBoxDim variable contains the Y dimension
      increment = innerBoxDim[1]/yCompartments;

      // if the number of y compartments is bigger than 1, do this:
      if ( yCompartments > 1) {
        // this loops several times to make each divider from 1 to the number of columns
        for ( i = [1 : cols]) {
          // move each divider into place
          // The translate statement needs to be updated so it moves in the Y axis
            translate([0, -innerBoxDim[1]/2+i*increment, 0])
              // draw a cube - this needs to draw the cube in an orientation 90 
              // degrees from the xDividers
              cube([innerBoxDim[0], ,dividerThick, innerBoxDim[2]], center =true);

        } // this bracket is the end of the "for" loop
      } // this bracket is the end of the IF statement
    } // end module
