How I designed this:
1. Create a sketch and label the elements that will need to be adjustable
2. Outline the features that will be customizable 
3. Outline the modules that will likely be necessary



Requirements
===========

Objectives
========
Students Will Learn...
-----------------------
* How to use variables 
* How to use modules
* How pass variables
  - scope of variables
* How to write a module
* The basics of parametric design
* How to create customizable SCAD files
* How to add a customizable Thing to Thingiverse
* A little about licences


Audience
========
* Users with some basic OpenSCAD experience
* Users that wish to improve their OpenSCAD skills
* Users that wish to learn the basics of Parametric Design/Customization

Preparation
===========
* [OpenSCAD 2015.03](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) or greater
* [Basic Understanding of OpenSCAD](https://i.materialise.com/blog/openscad-tutorial)
    - Basic understanding of the OpenSCAD language format
    - Ability to draw [primitives](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Primitive_Solids)
     - Ability to [transform objects](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Chapter_4_--_Transform) (rotate, translate, etc.)
     - Ability to [union()](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#union) and [difference()](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#difference) objects

Optional:
---------
* A [Thingiverse](htpp://thingiverse.com) account for customizing models 


Lesson 1: Introduction to the Customizer
=========
1. Open [this thing at Thingiverse.com](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1201466/) and launch the customizer
  - Note: You will need a free Thingiverse account.  If you do not have/want a thingiverse account please skip to Lesson 2
2. Play around with the customizable elements.  Try to make a box that has the following dimensions:
  - X: 30, Y: 50, Z:25
  - Wall thickness: 2
  - xCompartments: 4
  - yCompartments: 1 
3. Create an STL and download it later by clicking on the "Create Thing" link.

Questions
---------
* What could you customize on this box?
* Why is it useful to be able to customize objects?
* What happened as you input different values?
* Which features did not seem to work properly?
* What features would you like to add to this object?

Lesson 2: Customizing in OpenSCAD 
=========
1. Download [this thing]
